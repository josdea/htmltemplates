        <li>A systematic and orderly list of activities and/or events that will comprise the total allotted time for the course. The activities, whether based on units or topics, should correspond to the number of weeks of instruction. The 15th week is the final exam period.</li>

      <h2>Course Goals:</h2>
      <p>Course goals should be broad in scope. Statements of course goals should support, and be directly related to the TBR general education goals (for university parallel courses or the Pellissippi State Career Program goals. Examples of leading phrases include "the course will expand student understanding;" "the course will extend student knowledge;" "the course will guide students toward;" "the course will enhance the student’s knowledge;" "the course will enhance effective use."</p>
      <p class="lead">The course will:</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li> Enhance effective use of professionally accepted methods and materials in completion of applications. (III, V)</li>
        <li>Guide students to understand major themes and concerns of American literature as they relate to American history through the Civil War. I.1; II.1, 2, 5; IV.1</li>
        <li>Expand student understanding of basic inspection, measuring, and gauging concepts. (I, II)</li>
        <li>*Roman numerals after course objectives reference goals of the (______________) program.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Expected Student Learning Outcomes:</h2>
      <p>Each expected student learning outcome should be referenced to the course goals listed above. Expected Student Learning Outcomes are measurable results of the learning process. Create Expected Student Learning Outcomes using measurable verbs that identify explicitly what the student must do in order to demonstrate learning. See the list of action verbs associated with cognitive processes in Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy (adapted from A Faculty and Staff Guide to Creating Learning Outcomes, 2101, U. of South Carolina.) Expected Student Learning Outcomes should be achieved when course goals are met. As such, there should be multiple Expected Student Learning Outcomes to support each course goal. The relationship between the Expected Student Learning Outcomes and the course goals should be identified by referencing each statement of expectation to the relevant course goal. </p>

      <p>Pellissippi State expects students to attend all scheduled instructional activities. As a minimum, students in all courses (excluding distance learning courses) must be present for at least 75 percent of their scheduled class and laboratory meetings in order to receive credit for the course. Individual departments/programs/disciplines, with the approval of the vice president of Academic Affairs, may have requirements that are more stringent. In very specific circumstances, an appeal of the policy may be addressed to the head of the department in which the course was taken. If further action is warranted, the appeal may be addressed to the vice president of Academic Affairs. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cheating, including but not limited to unauthorized assistance from material, people, or devices when taking a test, quiz, or examination; writing papers or reports; solving problems; or completing academic assignments.</li>
        <li>Plagiarism, including but not limited to paraphrasing, summarizing, or directly quoting published or unpublished work of another person, including online or computerized services, without proper documentation of the original source.</li>
        <li>Purchasing or otherwise obtaining prewritten essays, research papers, or materials prepared by another person or agency that sells term papers or other academic materials to be presented as one’s own work. </li>
